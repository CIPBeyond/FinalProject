		<h1>Earth</h1>
		
		<img src="Content Photos/earth1.jpg" alt="Photo of earth"> <br><br>
		
		<p>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.<br><br>
		While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.<br><br>
		The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p><br>
		
		<h4>Planet Type</h4>
		<p>Terrestrial</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Moon/s</h4>
		<p>1</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
		<p>With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets, and the fifth largest planet overall.<br><br>
		From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.<br><br>
		It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.</p>
		
		<h4>Structure</h4>
		<p>Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet's center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle and crust.<br><br>
		The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 miles (1,221 kilometers) in radius. There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer core. This layer is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids.<br><br>
		In between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest layer. This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the sea floor to the top of the mantle.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>5 Need-to-Know Things about Earth</h4>
		<p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li class="m-list">MEASURING UP - If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel. </li>
				<li class="m-list">THIRD ROCK - Earth orbits our Sun, a star. Earth is the third planet from the Sun at a distance of about 93 million miles (150 million km).</li>
				<li class="m-list">AS THE WORLD TURNS - A day on Earth is 24 hours. Earth makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Earth time) in about 365 days.</li>
				<li class="m-list">BREATHE EASY - Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other ingredients the perfect balance to breathe and live.</li>
				<li class="m-list">PROTECTIVE SHIELD - Our atmosphere protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface.</li>

		<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
		<p>Guy Bluford, the first African-American in space, helped deliver an Earth weather satellite to orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger in September 1983.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Formation</h4>
		<p>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Potential for Life</h4>
		<p>Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life possible here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.<br><br>
		Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the ongoing effects of climate change.
