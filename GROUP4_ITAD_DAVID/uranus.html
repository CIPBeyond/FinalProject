		<h1>Uranus</h1>

		<p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.<br><br>
		It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.

		<h4>Planet Type</h4>
		<p>Ice Giant</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Moon/s</h4>
		<p>27</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
		<p>With a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers), Uranus is 4 times wider than Earth. If Earth was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.<br><br>
		From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is 19.8 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.</p>
		
		<h4>Structure</h4>
		<p>Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Neptune). Most (80 percent or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials—water, methane and ammonia—above a small rocky core. Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).<br><br>
		Uranus is slightly larger in diameter than its neighbor Neptune, yet smaller in mass. It is the second least dense planet; Saturn is the least dense of all.<br><br>
		Uranus gets its blue-green color from methane gas in the atmosphere. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and is reflected back out by Uranus' cloud tops. Methane gas absorbs the red portion of the light, resulting in a blue-green color.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>5 Need-to-Know Things about Uranus</h4>
		<p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li class="m-list">HUGE - Uranus is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were a large apple, Uranus would be the size of a basketball.</li>
				<li class="m-list">SEVENTH WANDERER - Uranus orbits our Sun, a star, and is the seventh planet from the Sun at a distance of about 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers).</li>
				<li class="m-list">SHORT-ISH DAY, LONGISH YEAR - Uranus takes about 17 hours to rotate once (a Uranian day), and about 84 Earth years to complete an orbit of the Sun (a Uranian year).</li>
				<li class="m-list">ICE GIANT - Uranus is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core.</li>
				<li class="m-list">MANY MOONS - Uranus has 27 known moons, and they are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</li>

		<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
		<p>Uranus' unique sideways rotation makes for weird seasons. The planet's north pole experiences 21 years of nighttime in winter, 21 years of daytime in summer and 42 years of day and night in the spring and fall.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Formation</h4>
		<p>Uranus took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Neptune, Uranus likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago, where it is the seventh planet from the Sun.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Potential for Life</h4>
		<p>Uranus' environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.</p> <br>
