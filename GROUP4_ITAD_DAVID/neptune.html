		<h1>Neptune</h1>

		<p>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.<br><br>
		More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.<br><br>
		NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. It flew past in 1989 on its way out of the solar system.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Planet Type</h4>

		<h4>Moon/s</h4>

		<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
		<p>With a radius of 15,299.4 miles (24,622 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.<br><br>
		From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.</p>
		
		<h4>Structure</h4>
		<p>Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80 percent or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials—water, methane and ammonia—above a small, rocky core. Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.<br><br>
		Scientists think there might be an ocean of super-hot water under Neptune's cold clouds. It does not boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>5 Need-to-Know Things about Uranus</h4>
		<p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li class="m-list">GIANT - Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were a large apple, Neptune would be the size of a basketball</li>
				<li class="m-list">EIGHTH WANDERER - Neptune orbits our Sun, a star, and is the eighth planet from the Sun at a distance of about 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers).</li>
				<li class="m-list">SHORT DAY, LONG YEAR - Neptune takes about 16 hours to rotate once (a Neptunian day), and about 165 Earth years to orbit the sun (a Neptunian year).</li>
				<li class="m-list">ICE GIANT - Neptune is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core.</li>
				<li class="m-list">ONE VOYAGE THERE - Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. No spacecraft has orbited this distant planet to study it at length and up close.</li>

		<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
		<p>Neptune is our solar system's windiest world. Winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 2,000 km/h (1,200 mph)—close to the top speed of a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet. Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 400 km/h (250 mph).</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Formation</h4>
		<p>Neptune took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Potential for Life</h4>
		<p>Neptune's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.</p> <br>
