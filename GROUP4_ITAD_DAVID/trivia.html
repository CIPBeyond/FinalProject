		<h2>Trivia # 1</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="trivia1">
			<p>Uranus is tilted on its side - Uranus appears to be a featureless blue ball upon first glance, but this gas giant of the outer solar system is pretty weird upon closer inspection. First, the planet rotates on its side for reasons scientists haven't quite figured out. The most likely explanation is that it underwent some sort of one or more titanic collisions in the ancient past. In any case, the tilt makes Uranus unique among the solar system planets.</p>

	<div class="mark2">
		<h2>Trivia # 2</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="trivia2">
		<p>Mars has the longest valley - If you thought the Grand Canyon was big, that's nothing compared to Valles Marineris. At 2,500 miles (4,000 km) long, this immense system of Martian canyons is more than 10 times as long as the Grand Canyon on Earth. Valles Marineris escaped the notice of early Mars spacecraft (which flew over other parts of the planet) and was finally spotted by the global mapping mission Mariner 9 in 1971. And what a sight it was to miss — Valles Marineris is about as long as the United States!</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="mark3">
		<h2>Trivia # 3</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="trivia3">
			<p>Solar System is 4.6 Billion Years Old - The solar system is 4.6 billion years old and 99.86% of its mass is contained in our Sun, a rotating yellow dwarf star whose powerful gravity causes numerous objects to revolve  around it in nearly circular orbits including the planets, moons, comets, asteroids, meteoroids, dust and gas.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="mark4">
		<h2>Trivia # 4</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="trivia4">
			<p>You grow as much as 5CM in space - Without the weight of gravity holding you down, you’re spine is able to expand to its full capacity in outer space. Some people grow as much as 5cm taller in space compared to on Earth.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="mark5">
		<h2>Trivia # 5</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="trivia5">
			<p>SPACE ISN’T AS FAR AWAY AS YOU MIGHT THINK - The Karman Line, located around 62-miles above Earth, marks the technical starting point of space. If you could drive your car straight up into the sky you’d reach this mark in less than one hour that’s less than some people drive to work each day!</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="mark6">
		<h2>Trivia # 6</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="trivia6">
			<p>Mercury is still shrinking - For many years, scientists believed that Earth was the only tectonically active planet in the solar system. That changed after the Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft did the first orbital mission at Mercury, mapping the entire planet in high definition and getting a look at the features on its surface.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="mark7">
		<h2>Trivia # 7</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="trivia7">
			<p>The sun is between 25,000 and 30,000 light - years from the supermassive black hole that forms the center of our galaxy. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, with curved arms of stars emanating from its center. Our solar system forms one of the smaller arms, called the Orion-Cygnus Arm, or simply the Orion Arm.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="mark8">
		<h2>Trivia # 8</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="trivia8">
			<p>If our solar system were the size of your hand, the Milky Way would cover North America, according to NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Night Sky Network. The boundary of the sun's gravitational influence extends about 122 astronomical units (AU), where one AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun, or is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="mark9">
		<h2>Trivia # 9</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="trivia9">
			<p>Neptune radiates more heat than it gets from the sun - Neptune is far away from Earth, and you can bet that scientists would love to get another spacecraft out there sometime soon. Perhaps today's technology could better answer some Neptunian mysteries, such as why the blue planet is giving off more heat than it receives. It's bizarre, considering that Neptune is so far away from the faint sun.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="mark10">
		<h2>Trivia # 10</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="trivia10">
			<p>Titan has a liquid cycle, but it's definitely not water - Another weird moon in Saturn's system is Titan, which hosts a liquid "cycle" that moves between the atmosphere and the surface. That sounds a lot like Earth, until you begin looking at its environment. It has lakes filled with methane and ethane, which could be reminiscent of the chemistry that occurred on Earth before life arose.</p>
