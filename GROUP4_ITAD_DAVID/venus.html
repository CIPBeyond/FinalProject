		<h1>Venus</h1>
		
		<img src="Content Photos/venus1.jpg" alt="Photo of venus"> <br><br>
		
		<p>Similar in size and structure to Earth, Venus has been called Earth's twin. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds. <br><br>
		Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of mostly sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.<br><br>
		Venus was the first planet to be explored by a spacecraft – NASA’s Mariner 2 successfully flew by and scanned the cloud-covered world on Dec. 14, 1962. Since then, numerous spacecraft from the U.S. and other space agencies have explored Venus, including NASA’s Magellan, which mapped the planet's surface with radar. The former Soviet Union is the only nation to land on the surface of Venus to date, though the spacecraft did not survive long in the harsh environment.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Planet Type</h4>
		<p>Terrestrial</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Moon/s</h4>
		<p>None</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
		<p>With a radius of 3,760 miles (6,052 kilometers), Venus is roughly the same size as Earth — just slightly smaller.<br><br>
		From an average distance of 67 million miles (108 million kilometers), Venus is 0.7 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. It takes sunlight 6 minutes to travel from the Sun to Venus.</p>
		
		<h4>Structure</h4>
		<p>Venus is in many ways similar to Earth in its structure. It has an iron core that is approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) in radius. Above that is a mantle made of hot rock slowly churning due to the planet's interior heat. The surface is a thin crust of rock that bulges and moves as Venus' mantle shifts and creates volcanoes.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>5 Need-to-Know Things about Venus</h4>
		<p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li class="m-list">EARTH-SIZED - If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, the Earth and Venus would each be about the size of a nickel. </li>
				<li class="m-list">SECOND ROCK - Venus orbits our Sun, a star. Venus is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million km).</li>
				<li class="m-list">A DAY LONGER THAN A YEAR - One day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days because Venus spins backwards, with its sun rising in the west and setting in the east.</li>
				<li class="m-list">MANY VISITORS - More than 40 spacecraft have explored Venus. The ‘90s Magellan mission mapped the planet's surface and Akatsuki is currently orbiting Venus.</li>
				<li class="m-list">LIFE ON VENUS - Venus’ extreme temperatures and acidic clouds make it an unlikely place for life as we know it.</li>
			</ol>
		</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
		<p>The Soviet Union’s Venera 13 survived the intense heat and crushing pressure of Venus’ surface for more than two hours. Engineers from several nations are currently studying methods to extend the life of robotic spacecraft in the extreme environment.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Formation</h4>
		<p>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Venus formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form the second planet from the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Venus has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Potential for Life</h4>
		<p>No human has visited Venus, but the spacecraft that have been sent to the surface of Venus do not last very long there. Venus' high surface temperatures overheat electronics in spacecraft in a short time, so it seems unlikely that a person could survive for long on the Venusian surface.<br><br>
		There is speculation about life existing in Venus' distant past, as well as questions about the possibility of life in the top cloud layers of Venus' atmosphere, where the temperatures are less extreme.</p> <br>
