		<h1>Mercury</h1>
		
		<img src="Content Photos/mercury1.jpg" alt="Photo of mercury"> <br><br>
		
		<p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.<br><br>
		From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – which title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
		</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Planet Type</h4>
		<p>Terrestrial</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Moon/s</h4>
		<p>None</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
		<p>With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.<br><br>From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.</p>
		
		<h4>Structure</h4>
		<p>Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85 percent of the planet's radius. There is evidence that it is partly molten, or liquid. Mercury's outer shell, comparable to Earth's outer shell (called the mantle and crust), is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>5 Need-to-Know Things about Mercury</h4>
		<p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li class="m-list">SMALLEST – Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system—only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</li>
				<li class="m-list">INSIDER – It is the closest planet to the Sun at a distance of about 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) or 0.39 AU.</li>
				<li class="m-list">LONG DAYS, SHORT YEARS – One day on Mercury (the time it takes for Mercury to rotate or spin once with respect to the stars) takes 59 Earth days. One day-night cycle on Mercury takes 175.97 Earth days. Mercury makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Mercury time) in just 88 Earth days</li>
				<li class="m-list">ROUGH SURFACE – Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.</li>
				<li class="m-list">MOONLESS – Mercury has no moons.</li>
			</ol>
		</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
		<p>Because of Mercury's elliptical egg-shaped orbit and sluggish rotation, the morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Mercury's Temperature</h4>
		<p>Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Formation</h4>
		<p>Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Potential for Life</h4>
		<p>Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.</p> <br>
