		<h1>Saturn</h1>
		
		<img src="Content Photos/saturn1.jpg" alt="Photo of saturn"> <br><br>
		
		<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system.<br><br>
		Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings made of chunks of ice and rock but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.<br><br>
		Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Planet Type</h4>
		<p>Gas Giant</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Moon/s</h4>
		<p>53 confirmed | 29 provisional</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
		<p>With a radius of 36,183.7 miles (58,232 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a volleyball.<br><br>
		From an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn.</p>
		
		<h4>Structure</h4>
		<p>Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At Saturn's center is a dense core of metals like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by the intense pressure and heat. It is enveloped by liquid metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen—similar to Jupiter's core but considerably smaller.<br><br>
		It's hard to imagine, but Saturn is the only planet in our solar system whose average density is less than water. The giant gas planet could float in a bathtub if such a colossal thing existed.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>5 Need-to-Know Things about Saturn</h4>
		<p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li class="m-list">A COLOSSAL PLANET - Nine Earths side by side would almost span Saturn’s diameter. That doesn’t include Saturn’s rings</li>
				<li class="m-list">IN DIM LIGHT - Saturn is the sixth planet from our Sun (a star) and orbits at a distance of about 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from the Sun.</li>
				<li class="m-list">SHORT DAY, LONG YEAR - Saturn takes about 10.7 hours (no one knows precisely) to rotate on its axis once—a Saturn “day”—and 29 Earth years to orbit the sun.</li>
				<li class="m-list">AS GIANT - Saturn is a gas-giant planet and therefore does not have a solid surface like Earth’s. But it might have a solid core somewhere in there.</li>
				<li class="m-list">RARE DESTINATION - Few missions have visited Saturn: Pioneer 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2 flew by; But Cassini orbited Saturn 294 times from 2004 to 2017.</li>
			</ol>

		<h4>Did You Know?</h4>
		<p>Twice every 29 and a half years the great planet Saturn appears ring less. This is an optical illusion. Earthlings cannot see Saturn's rings when the rings are edge-on as viewed from the Earth. They are barely visible through powerful telescopes.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Formation</h4>
		<p>Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this gas giant. About 4 billion years ago, Saturn settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the Sun.
		</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Potential for Life</h4>
		<p>Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br><br>
		While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life.</p> <br>
