		<h4>What Does a Scientist in the Space Sector Do?</h4><br>
		<p><b class="first">D</b>r. Stanley G. Love was selected as a NASA astronaut in 1998. He has Master of Science and Doctorate of Philosophy degrees in Astronomy from the University of Washington in Seattle. In 2008, Dr. Love flew aboard STS-122 to deliver and install the European Space Agencyâ€™s Columbus module to the station. While onboard, Dr. Love performed two spacewalks to prepare for the installation, add two science payloads, and carry a failed ISS gyroscope to the shuttle for return to Earth. He currently works as the Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office's Rapid Prototying Laboratory, developing cockpit displays and controls for Orion and forthcoming spacecraft.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Stanley Love Experience</h4>
		<p>Dr. Love worked summers at the University of Oregon in Eugene as a computer programming instructor (1984) and as an assistant in physics and chemistry laboratories (1985-1987). As a graduate teaching assistant at the University of Washington in Seattle, beginning in 1987, he taught undergraduate courses in general and planetary astronomy. He was a graduate research assistant at the University of Washington from 1989 to 1993, working on a projects including space propulsion and energy storage, stellar photometry and spectroscopy, analysis of space-exposed surfaces, hypervelocity impact and particle capture, atmospheric entry heating of micrometeoroids, infrared imaging of the zodiacal light, and electron microscopy of interplanetary dust particles. Love moved to the University of Hawaii in Honolulu in 1994 for postdoctoral research on the formation of meteoritic chondrules, the collisional evolution of asteroids, and the possibility of meteorites from the planet Mercury. Love was awarded the O.K. Earl prize postdoctoral fellowship at the California Institute of Technology in 1995. His work there included computational fluid dynamic simulations of asteroid collisions, calibration of the Cassini spacecraft's dust-particle impact detector, and experimental shock compression of the mineral calcite. Love transferred to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a staff engineer in 1997 to work on computer simulations of spacecraft optical instrument systems and to participate in a laboratory-wide process re-engineering effort.</p>
