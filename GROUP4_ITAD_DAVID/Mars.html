		<h1>Mars</h1>
		
		<img src="Content Photos/mars1.jpg" alt="Photo of mars"> <br><br>
		
		<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun â€“ a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.<br><br>
		Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. Two NASA rovers and one lander are currently exploring the surface of Mars (and a Chinese lander is set to land later this year). An international fleet of eight orbiters are studying the Red Planet from above.</p><br>
		
		<h4>Planet Type</h4>
		<p>Terrestrial</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Moon/s</h4>
		<p>0</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Size and Distance</h4>
		<p>With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.<br><br>
		From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.</p>
		
		<h4>Structure</h4>
		<p>Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>5 Need-to-Know Things about Mars</h4>
		<p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li class="m-list">SMALL PLANET - If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet.</li>
				<li class="m-list">FOURTH ROCK - Mars orbits our Sun, a star. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun at an average distance of about 228 million km (142 million miles) or 1.52 AU.</li>
				<li class="m-list">LONGER DAYS - One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.</li>
				<li class="m-list">MANY MISSIONS - Several missions have visited this planet, from flybys and orbiters to rovers on the surface. The first true Mars mission success was the Mariner 4 flyby in 1965.</li>
				<li class="m-list">RUSTY PLANET - Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.</li>
			</ol>
		</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Formation</h4>
		<p>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.</p> <br>
		
		<h4>Potential for Life</h4>
		<p>Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.
